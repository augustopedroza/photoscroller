# PhotoScroller - MVVM
This app by default displays the most recent Flickr photos. It also allows the user to search for photos for a specific flickr user name. The main goal of this app is to show how to use MVVM and the new architecture components.
## Activities
### PhotoGalleryActivity
* Uses constraint layout to show its simplicity but in reality that screen is so simple that the full benefits of a flat layout are not leveraged (It is not computationally expensive).
* Since the list of pictures might be large, a RecyclerView has been chosen to display thumbnails.

### PhotoActivity
* Uses a more traditional layout.
* Leverages data binding to implement the MVVM pattern. I am a strong advocate of this pattern due to its test friendliness, clear division of UI code and business logic and very concise code to support UI updates. 

## 3rd Party Components
* Retrofit - HTTP client that allows a simple interface to define endpoints. 
* okhttp - Highly flexible HTTP client. It also includes WebSocket support.
* Butterknife - Provides a clean way to access view components.
* Glide
* Dagger2

## Recommended Improvements / Future work
### Architecture
* Write a generic ViewModel factory.
### Error handling
It is horrendous in its current state.
* Handle nwtork error cases.
* Provide localized error messages.
* Do not use toasts for error messages.
### Tests
Let's be honest, these tests are useless!!
* Dependency injection provides higher testability since it provides a loosely coupled design. Use a dagger test component.
* Mock network to avoid false positives dues to network instability.
* Rely on mockito and espresso.
* Write UI unit tests using Robolectric.
### UI
It is plain ugly!
* The Grid view should adapt its number of columns to the screen size (including tablets) and to landscape mode.
* Use a modern action bar.
* Construct photo URL based on display size. The PhotoActivity should fetch a larger size.

### Additional recommended 3rd party components
* RxJava - Provides a powerful observable pattern framework.
* Realm - Cloud Data for android. It greatly simplifyes data management support.
## Bugs
* The network service is blindly adding the same query parameters to all requests even when they are not needed.
